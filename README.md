# Speech-Emotion-Recognition-

**Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) Project**

Welcome to the Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) project! This repository is dedicated to the development of an advanced system that can detect the emotional state of a speaker from the speech signal. Speech Emotion Recognition is a fascinating field that combines signal processing, machine learning, and natural language understanding to gain insights into the emotional content of spoken language.

**Objective:**
The primary goal of this project is to create a robust and accurate Speech Emotion Recognition system. By analyzing the acoustic features of speech signals, our model aims to identify and classify various emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and more. This technology holds immense potential in applications ranging from human-computer interaction to sentiment analysis in customer service.

**Key Features:**
- Utilizes state-of-the-art signal processing techniques to extract relevant features from speech signals.
- Implements machine learning models, possibly deep learning architectures, for effective emotion classification.
- Supports real-time emotion recognition for dynamic applications.
- Aims for high accuracy across a diverse range of emotional states.

**Getting Started:**
1. Clone the repository: `gh repo clone RAHULSIWACH360/Speech-Emotion-Recognition-`
2. Explore the provided datasets and preprocessing scripts.
3. Train and evaluate the SER model using the provided notebooks or scripts.
